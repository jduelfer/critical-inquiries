This website is for common readers and aspiring writers. Why do we love reading? How can we contribute to the community? There's so much information and material out there that it feels impossible to sift through. Through reviews, articles and lists I will try to organize what I read in order to share my opinions with anybody interested, and hopefully get some interesting feedback.

I would also like to start writing at some point in my life, but where can I begin? Has everything been said already? Do I even have a voice that people want to listen to? Would they ever want to hear what I have to say? If people were to listen, what even do I have to say? Hopefully through inspecting the material that I read in an organized manner, I will get a few steps closer to answering some of these questions.

Please comment freely about anything on the website, I would love to have your opinions and feedback.
